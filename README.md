Undergraduate research project where I receieved images (in infrared) from the new LIRAC instrument on the Liverpool telescope. My project was to commence analysis on each image to produce a brightness limit on the telescope.

To run code, FITS images must be downloaded into same directory.

AvgZPCalc looks at many FITS images and calculates an average zero point magnitude and its error for several images using aperture methods - disc where outer area calculates background states and inner circle contains star which calculates stats for the stars. Calculations based on flux readings for image (birghtness) which is processed into a value for magnitude (standarised brightness).
